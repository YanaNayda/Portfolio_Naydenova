# Other Experience

## 8th National Hackathon at HIT
**Date:** Month 2025  
**Duration:** 36 hours  
**Team size:** 7 people  

A month ago, I participated in the 8th National Hackathon at HIT, and it was an incredibly valuable experience. Our team tackled a real challenge: taxi drivers who use WhatsApp while driving, leading to distraction and accidents.  

**Our solution:** a compact HUD (head-up display) with voice control that projects ride information onto a transparent screen, allowing drivers to stay focused on the road.  

**What we did:**  
- Built a working app prototype  
- Conducted research on user needs and safety  
- Designed a full business model  

Although we didn’t win first place, the experience taught me:  
- Stronger teamwork skills  
- Understanding different approaches for each teammate  
- The importance of presenting ideas effectively, not just having a good idea  

This hackathon was a meaningful journey that strengthened my problem-solving and collaboration skills.
