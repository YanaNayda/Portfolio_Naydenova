## Key Achievements

I am especially proud of my project **DMT-Proms**, as it provided me with extensive experience not only in development but also in teamwork. What makes this project important to me is its social impact — it was created to help assess cognitive abilities in elderly people.

## Work Approach

I usually work on projects in a team environment and under tight deadlines. When learning new technologies, I prefer hands-on practice, as I find that real projects help information stick best. I often use YouTube, ChatGPT, and maintain detailed notes in Obsidian for learning new skills effectively.

## Personal Interests

I am passionate about dancing, which provides me both physical and mental relaxation. After a dance session, I can approach problems from a fresh perspective. One of my strongest qualities is persistence and determination — even if something doesn’t work on the first or tenth attempt, I will keep trying until I succeed.
